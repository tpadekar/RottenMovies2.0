Since Dom (Diesel) and Brian's (Walker) Rio heist toppled a kingpin's empire and left their crew with $100 million, our heroes have scattered across the globe. But their inability to return home and living forever on the lam have left their lives incomplete. Meanwhile, Hobbs (Johnson) has been tracking an organization of lethally skilled mercenary drivers across 12 countries, whose mastermind (Evans) is aided by a ruthless second-in-command revealed to be the love Dom thought was dead, Letty (Rodriguez). The only way to stop the criminal outfit is to outmatch them at street level, so Hobbs asks Dom to assemble his elite team in London. Payment? Full pardons for all of them so they can return home and make their families whole again. Building on the worldwide blockbuster success of Fast Five and taking the action, stunts and narrative to even greater heights, Fast & Furious 6 sees director Justin Lin back behind the camera for the fourth time. He is supported by longtime producers Neal H. Moritz and Vin Diesel, who welcome producer Clayton Townsend back to the series.

In The Purge, a speculative thriller that follows one family over the course of a single night, four people will be tested to see how far they will go to protect themselves when the vicious outside world breaks into their home. In an America wracked by crime and overcrowded prisons, the government has sanctioned an annual 12-hour period in which any and all criminal activity-including murder-becomes legal. The police can't be called. Hospitals suspend help. It's one night when the citizenry regulates itself without thought of punishment. On this night plagued by violence and an epidemic of crime, one family wrestles with the decision of who they will become when a stranger comes knocking. When an intruder breaks into James Sandin's (Ethan Hawke) gated community during the yearly lockdown, he begins a sequence of events that threatens to tear a family apart. Now, it is up to James, his wife, Mary (Lena Headey), and their kids to make it through the night without turning into the monsters from whom they hide.

Chasing his own American Dream, Nick lands next door to a mysterious, party-giving millionaire, Jay Gatsby (Leonardo DiCaprio), and across the bay from his cousin, Daisy (Carey Mulligan), and her philandering, blue-blooded husband, Tom Buchanan (Joel Edgerton). It is thus that Nick is drawn into the captivating world of the super rich, their illusions, loves and deceits. As Nick bears witness, within and without of the world he inhabits, he pens a tale of impossible love, incorruptible dreams and high-octane tragedy, and holds a mirror to our own modern times and struggles. -- (C) WB","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://content7.flixster.com/movie/11/17/12/11171265_mob.jpg","profile":"http://content7.flixster.com/movie/11/17/12/11171265_pro.jpg","detailed":"http://content7.flixster.com/movie/11/17/12/11171265_det.jpg","original":"http://content7.flixster.com/movie/11/17/12/11171265_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Leonardo DiCaprio","id":"162659161","characters":["Jay Gatsby"]},{"name":"Tobey Maguire","id":"162660340","characters":["Nick Carraway"]},{"name":"Carey Mulligan","id":"770678627","characters":["Daisy Buchanan"]},{"name":"Isla Fisher","id":"162652839","characters":["Myrtle","Myrtle Wilson"]},{"name":"Joel Edgerton","id":"162733204","characters":["Tom Buchanan"]}],"alternate_ids":{"imdb":"1343092"},"links":{"self":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771240552.json","alternate":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_great_gatsby_2012/","cast":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771240552/cast.json","clips":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771240552/clips.json","reviews":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771240552/reviews.json","similar":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771240552/similar.json"}},{"id":"771315620","title":"Before Midnight","year":2013,"mpaa_rating":"R","runtime":108,"critics_consensus":"Building on the first two installments in Richard Linklater's well-crafted Before trilogy, Before Midnight offers intelligent, powerfully acted perspectives on love, marriage, and long-term commitment.","release_dates":{"theater":"2013-05-24"},"ratings":{"critics_rating":"Certified Fresh","critics_score":97,"audience_rating":"Upright","audience_score":91},"synopsis":"Before Midnight is an upcoming American romance drama film and the sequel to Before Sunrise (1995) and Before Sunset (2004).

In 1946, Branch Rickey (Harrison Ford) put himself at the forefront of history when he signed Jackie Robinson (Chadwick Boseman) to the team, breaking Major League Baseball's infamous color line. But the deal also put both Robinson and Rickey in the firing line of the public, the press and even other players. Facing unabashed racism from every side, Robinson was forced to demonstrate tremendous courage and restraint by not reacting in kind, knowing that any incident could destroy his and Rickey's hopes. Instead, Number 42 let his talent on the field do the talking-ultimately winning over fans and his teammates, silencing his critics, and paving the way for others to follow.
